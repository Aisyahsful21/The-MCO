Health is very important for me, because it will effect our mentality and actuveness on doing some work. Before this i used to jogging outside with my friend, but for now I only workout inside the house. All i do is a quick search on Youtube workout that i can do at home without using any equipment. Here some video of work out that i used watch, You can click on the link up above.

The second thing I do during the MCO is clean my room everyweek.It is to make sure that the roachers and spiders dont get too comfortable. A very full cleanness overhaul can take time, especially if i am not that type that mulls over should or not should be thrown. For me it was fun to have a clean and nice scented room. Other than that I can have a new living spaces in my room and house that before this not so clean becoming clean.
    
<h4>Watching Movie</h4>

I am really enjoyed watching my favourite show and movie from Netlix to Youtube and i loved to give recommendation to my friends and family about a movie that I cant move on. I already watch my favourite korean drama series like 2 times already because I will never get bored watching the same movie over and over again. I always watch movie when all my work already done.

<h5>Playing Games</h5>

From traditional games, tagging games online, video games, facebook games to mobile games, I believe people who love to playing game already do all thing that I list. I also believed all of us do playing game because the MCO make us do that. I never thought that I already have a bunch of games on my phone.It was like almost everyday I play game especially the game named Player Unknown Battleground (PUBG). abaut at the same time my assignmnet is more important than the game.

<h6>Thats all that I do during the MCO. Hoping that covid-19 will be  end soon, so that we can do our daily routine agian. Thankyou</h6>
